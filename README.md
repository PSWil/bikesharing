# Citi Bike Analysis

View the City Bike Tableau story [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stuart.wilson2140/viz/CityBikeAnalysisNYC/CityBikeAnalysisNYC?publish=yes). 

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to use data from New York City's Citi Bike program and see if we could recreate the program in De Moines. To complete this analysis, I used Python's pandas to clean up the data and then used Tableau to create the visualizations.

## Results

### How long do users bike for?
This visualization shows the length of time of every bike ride during the month of August in 2019. It shows that riders typically like to bike between 2 and 15 minutes.

### Who is using the bikes?
This visualization shows the breakdown of riders by gender and duration of times showing that most of the users are men.

To further these findings, this visualizations shows that the most common user is a male subscriber (meaning that they have signed up for a long term contract with citi bike) and there most frequent day of the week to ride on is Thursday.

### When are users using the bikes?
This visualizations shows that weekday rider traffic peaks at traditional commuting times, while weekends see gradual use throughout the day.

Additionally, there is no differenece in patern when broken down by gender.

### Where are they biking to and from?
These two visualizations show the the top starting and ending locations. The first thing is that most rides start in the most populous areas in mid and lower Manhattan. Second, due to shorter ride times, the ending locations are also in those same populous areas but generally further away from the city center.
